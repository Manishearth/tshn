        <h1><small>What is this?</small></h1> 
        Pretty simple. Every 15 minutes, TSHN scrapes the first page of Hacker News and generates a new page containing the top stories from the past 24 hours sorted in descending order by overall points.

        <h1><small>Why the hell would you want to do that? </small></h1>
        I was bored as we were having our winter holidays, so I started reading about <a href="http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/">Beautiful Soup</a>. I was simultaneously checking out HN in a different tab. <br/>So I thought HN could be a nice place to start scraping. This is pretty useful as I keep checking on HN quite a few times during the whole day, having a sorted view for posts helps me read the interesting stuff first ^_^ <br/>
        Also a friend pointed out, it is particularly useful in the morning too check on interesting posts, which could have gone buried while you were sleeping!

        <h1><small>How'd you do it? </small></h1>
        Pretty simple! The code's up on <a href="https://github.com/sushant-hiray/tshn">GitHub</a>.<br/>
        As I had mentioned before take a look at <a href="http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/">Beautiful Soup</a> and see how you can go about scraping the relevant data.<br/>
        Once you are done with this, rest is just simple python script to combine the scraped data.<br/>
        Thanks to <a href="http://www.getbootstrap.com">Bootstrap</a> for the minimal UI.<br/>
        Make ajax calls to fetch the data.<br/>
        That's it.<br/><br/>
